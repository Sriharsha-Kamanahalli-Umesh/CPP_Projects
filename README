C++ projects:

* How to build
    * create build directory using **mkdir build** (insted of name build you can give any name)
    * go to the build directory using **cd build**
    * run **cmake ..** in build directory to generate build system
    * finally run **make** to build the project

    OR

    * just run the build_project.sh script
        ./build_project.sh this will run whole project files
